# self-persisting-computation
A proof-of-concept PHP script demonstrating self-modifying code that optimizes computation by persisting results directly into its own source code.

Each time a new input is processed, the result is stored in the code itself, reducing the need for repeated expensive calculations. This approach trades increasing code size for faster execution over time — ideal for cases with complex calculations and a limited set of typical inputs.

This is an experimental idea — feel free to contribute and expand the concept!
